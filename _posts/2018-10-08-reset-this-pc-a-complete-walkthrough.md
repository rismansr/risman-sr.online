<p><em>Reset This PC</em> is a recovery feature available in <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217">Windows 10</a> that lets you reinstall Windows again from scratch with just a few taps or clicks, much like a factory reset or restore but <em>no install disc or flash drive is needed</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You even have the option of keeping or removing your personal <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-file-2625878">files</a> in the process!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/reset-this-pc-2626216">Reset This PC: What It Is &amp; How to Use It</a> for more on this "solution of last resort" and when it's a good idea to use.</p>

<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-3">A Note for Windows 8 Users</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235">Windows 8</a>, the Reset This PC tool exists as two distinct and similarly-named processes, <em>Refresh Your PC</em> and <em>Reset Your PC</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Basically, Windows 8's <em>Refresh Your PC</em> is the same as the <em>Keep my files</em> choice in Reset This PC in Windows 10, and its <em>Reset Your PC</em> equates to the <em>Remove everything</em> choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We'll call out any important differences between the reset processes of Windows 10 and Windows 8 throughout this tutorial but, for the most part, they'll be the same.01of 12</p>

<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0">Open the Advanced Startup Options Menu &amp; Choose Troubleshoot</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fCtJ42AYL8z2Z0Z6wBk4WLiIZyw=/1366x768/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/advanced-startup-options-windows-10-56a6fad85f9b58b7d0e5d1a3.png" alt="Screenshot of the Advanced Startup Options menu in Windows 10"/><figcaption> Advanced Startup Options in Windows 10.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The easiest way to start the Reset This PC process is from the <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-startup-options-2625805">Advanced Startup Options</a> menu, shown in the screenshot above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The great thing about Advanced Startup Options is that there are at least a half-dozen ways to bring it up, which is super helpful considering that the tools there, like Reset This PC, can fix problems that are preventing you from using Windows normally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If Windows 10 is starting correctly</strong>, the best way to access the ASO menu is via <em>Settings</em>. Just tap or click on <em>Settings</em> from the <em>Start Menu</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If Windows 10 is not starting correctly</strong>, the best way to bring up the ASO menu is via the <em>Repair your computer</em> link after <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-booting-mean-2625799">booting</a> from your installation media or recovery drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-access-advanced-startup-options-in-windows-10-or-8-2626229">How to Access Advanced Startup Options</a> if you need some more help with either method, or you need some more options. We list six different ways in that piece, so one is likely to work out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once at the ASO menu, tap or click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.02of 12</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-8">Choose the Reset This PC Option</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BhzArF5T9wA5t8yOtK6JSfJkWuI=/1366x768/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/troubleshoot-screen-aso-menu-windows-10-56a6fad83df78cf772913fd1.png" alt="Screenshot of the Troubleshoot menu screen, part of the Advanced Startup Options in Windows 10"/><figcaption> Troubleshoot ASO Menu in Windows 10.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the Troubleshoot screen in Advanced Startup Options, choose the <strong>Reset this PC</strong> option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you'll see, it says <em>Lets you choose to keep or remove your files, and then reinstalls Windows</em>, so don't worry that you haven't yet told Windows 10 to keep your personal files. That's coming up next in Step 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This screen looks a little different in Windows 8. Choose <strong>Refresh your PC</strong> if you want to reinstall Windows 8 but you want to keep your personal files (like saved music, documents, etc.) or <strong>Reset your PC</strong> if you want to reinstall Windows 8 <em>without</em> keeping any of your files.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skip to Step 4 of this tutorial after making that choice in Windows 8 or check out Step 3 (even though it's for the Windows 10 folks) if you're not sure which one to choose or are confused about what might happen.03of 12</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-14">Choose to Keep Personal Files or Remove Everything</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vse5MhDG0dWhN4xTcwGuFiwnHN4=/1366x768/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/reset-this-pc-screen-aso-windows-10-56a6fad85f9b58b7d0e5d1a6.png" alt="Screenshot of the Reset This PC menu screen, part of the Advanced Startup Options in Windows 10"/><figcaption> Reset This PC ASO Menu in Windows 10.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Windows 10, this is the Reset This PC screen you'll see next, headed with <em>Choose an option</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose either <strong>Keep my files</strong>, <strong>Remove everything</strong>, or <strong>Restore factory settings</strong> to continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a very important choice, so I want to make sure you completely understand what you're doing before you move forward:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-19">Option 1: Keep my files</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose <strong>Keep my files</strong> to <em>keep</em> your personal files, <em>remove</em> all installed software and apps, and <em>reinstall</em> Windows 10 from scratch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windows 10 will back up your personal data and tuck it away safely while it reinstalls itself from scratch. When complete, Windows 10 will appear much like when you first bought your computer or installed it yourself. You <em>may</em> need to reconfigure some custom settings and you <em>will</em> need to <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478">reinstall any software</a> you want again, but your saved files will be waiting for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-22">Option 2: Remove everything</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose <strong>Remove everything</strong> to <em>remove</em> your personal files, <em>remove</em> all installed software and apps, and <em>reinstall</em> Windows 10 from scratch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windows 10 will erase everything on the drive its installed onto and then reinstall itself from scratch. When complete, Windows 10 will appear much like when you first bought your computer or installed it yourself. You <em>may</em> need to reconfigure some custom settings and you <em>will</em> need to reinstall any software you want again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-25">Option 3: Restore factory settings</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This option only shows up on some computers and is not reflected in the screenshot example above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose <strong>Restore factory settings</strong> to <em>remove</em> your personal files, <em>remove</em> all installed software, and <em>reinstall</em> the operating system and preinstalled software that originally came with your computer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windows 10 will erase everything on the drive and then return your computer back to the exact state it was in when you first purchased in. In most cases, this means all of the preinstalled software will be reinstalled and the version of Windows that was on your computer when you bought it will be there again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-29">Not Sure Which to Choose?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All options accomplish the same thing if you're doing a Reset This PC to solve a major computer issue, so choosing <strong>Keep my files</strong> is the safer bet in most cases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common reason to choose <strong>Remove everything</strong> or <strong>Restore factory settings</strong> would be if you were selling or giving away the computer afterwards and you wanted to make sure nothing of yours was left to dig up later. Starting over after a major <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-malware-2625933">malware</a> infection is another good reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Important:</strong> <em>Only the last option, if present, allows you to keep your installed software programs and apps!</em> With the first two choices, you'll need to reinstall all of your software once the Restart This PC process is over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> One really easy way to protect yourself from mistakes with Reset This PC, or any process that might mean your important files are at risk, is to make sure you're backing up! <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/online-backup-services-reviewed-2624712">Online backup services</a> are best but <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-backup-software-tools-2617964">traditional local backup software</a>works, too.04of 12</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-34">Wait While the Reset This PC Process Prepares to Start</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/63kAulqBQHi8fagu8QgGztKzSgo=/1024x768/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/preparing-screen-post-reboot-reset-this-pc-windows-10-56a6fadb5f9b58b7d0e5d1af.png" alt="Screenshot of the Preparing splash screen, as part of the Reset This PC process in Windows 10"/><figcaption> The Preparing Splash Screen During the Windows 10 Reset This PC Process.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immediately after making your <em>Keep my files</em> or <em>Remove everything</em> choice, your computer may or may not restart, depending on how you got to the <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-startup-options-2625805">ASO menu</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of Windows 10 or Windows 8 starting up as usual, you'll see this <em>Preparing</em>screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is pretty much what you're thinking - the Reset This PC process is loading. There's nothing to do here but wait, and probably only for several seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Go to Step 5</strong> if you chose <em>Keep my files</em> (or <em>Refresh your PC</em> in Windows 8)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Go to Step 7</strong> if you chose <em>Remove everything</em> (or <em>Reset your PC</em> in Windows 8)05of 12</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once Reset This PC is loaded, you'll see this screen, hopefully with your account name clearly available as an option, much like you see mine here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since you've chosen to have Reset This PC keep your personal files, continuing with this process is restricted to someone that already has access to this computer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tap or click on your account, or whatever account is listed that you know the password for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only user accounts with <em>administrator</em> level access can be used to start Reset This PC, so only those appear here. Most regular Windows 10 and Windows 8 users have this kind of access, which lets you run diagnostic and repair utilities, among other things. If you don't see any account listed, you'll have to restart this process and choose <em>Remove everything</em>, meaning you won't be able to keep any personal data.06of 12</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few moments after choosing your account name, you'll see this screen, asking for the password for your account.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enter the password for this account in the field provided and then press or click <strong>Continue</strong>, then <strong>go to Step 8</strong> (Step 7 only applies if you had chosen <em>not</em> to keep your personal files).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you've forgotten your password, and you sign in to Windows with an email address, you can reset that password from any other computer or smartphone.

<p>If you don't use an email address, or that doesn't work, you have a short list of other options, all of which are explained in detail in <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/i-forgot-my-windows-8-password-what-are-my-options-2626238">I Forgot My Windows 10/8 Password!

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next up, assuming you chose to <em>Remove everything</em>, is an important, but somewhat confusing, choice on how to continue with the Reset This PC process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose either <strong>Just remove my files</strong> or <strong>Fully clean the drive</strong> to continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-57">Option 1: Just remove my files</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose <strong>Just remove my files</strong> to continue as planned, removing everything and reinstalling Windows from scratch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose this option if you're doing a Reset This PC to fix a computer problem you're having and you plan on using the computer normally after it's over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-60">Option 2: Fully clean the drive</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose <strong>Fully clean the drive</strong> to removing everything, <em>then wipe the drive clean</em>, and finally reinstall Windows from scratch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose this option if, after the Reset This PC process is over, you plan on giving the computer away, selling it, or recycling the computer or <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152">hard drive</a>. This option is also best if you've had serious malware issues you're trying to get rid of, especially viruses that impact the <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-boot-sector-2625815">boot sector</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>Fully clean the drive</em> method will take much longer than the <em>Just remove my files</em> one, adding anywhere from an hour to several hours to the total process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-64">More on the 'Clean the Drive' Option</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those of you curious, this <em>cleaning</em> of the drive is the same as a <em>hard drive wipe</em>, which is usually done manually before getting rid of a computer, outlined in our <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-wipe-a-hard-drive-2624527">How to Wipe a Hard Drive</a> tutorial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A <em>wipe</em> of a hard drive is a complete overwriting of the data that's there, ensuring that no one can ever undelete or recover the files, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893">no matter what tools are at their disposal</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's not clear what specific <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/data-sanitization-methods-2626133">data sanitization method</a> Microsoft uses during the Reset This PC process, but we'd guess it's a basic <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-write-zero-method-2626052">write-zero</a>, probably via the <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/format-command-2618091">format command</a>.08of 12</p>
